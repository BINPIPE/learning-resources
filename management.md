# Engineering Management

There are very few engineers who want to grow into "Technical" _Software Engineering Manager_. Instead they prefer to be a Tech Lead or an Architect. People think that management is difficult. Why? Because, this role is not about __just__ the Tech. It is easier to fight with technology, but difficult to get people together and trust you! That's the challenge! Are you in for it?

Being an _Engineering Manager or Leader_ requires to have diverse skill sets and wear multiple hats to be effective. For sure, these skills are rare to find in one person, but we can learn and improve. A great engineering manager/leader should be a constant learner, challenging his/her (past) preception, being aware of the tech-stack, first user of the product, a decision maker, mentoring people and should work towards _Success For All_!

Instead of reading some multi-page books, I prefer to read real experiences of people and their advices. These are typically available as journal articles or blogs. This gives me diverse prespective on how others are doing thier job, and what should I improve on. Here is a curated list of articles and advices that I found helpful, and shall help you becoming an _awesome software engineering leader_!

_Note: There exists many other reading lists in the wild. This page lists articles that I have read and recommend to my fellows._
