```

There is a Static Website for a company. And this website needs to be deployed using automated CI/CD on Amazon Cloud Servers.

So basically the following has to be done:
```
- Deploy 2 EC2 instances (Ansible+Jenkins & WebServer)
- Create & Apply Playbooks to set up each of the above
- Create Pipeline in Jenkins
- Deploy the simple-website from https://github.com/BINPIPE/simple-website via the simple pipeline.
```
In other words, the requirement is to Create EC2 instances, install the prerequisites, checkout the code, run the pipeline.

```
(JENKINS+ANSIBLE)-------CI/CD Pipeline---------> (WEBSERVER)
```

[Refer the Solution Here!](https://github.com/BINPIPE/simple-cicd-ec2):

The below repositories are to be used.

```
- https://github.com/BINPIPE/simple-cicd-ec2   ---> Playbook Repo for CI/CD
- https://github.com/BINPIPE/simple-website ---> Code Repo for Website
```

Automating infrastructure and writing code to do it are among the main responsibilities of DevOps engineers.

To make sure you can do both, we give you this home assignment. Please create a repository on GitHub or Bitbucket with the following:

- Build a virtual machine or EC2 instance with a Linux-based operating system of your choice. Please use a publicly available box.
- An Ansible playbook (with any associated roles or files), that can install WordPress blog on this virtual machine.
- A Python script that can create blog posts on the WordPress installation given an input text file with the post content.
- A README file to help us run the above.

[Install Nagios on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nagios-4-and-monitor-your-servers-on-ubuntu-18-04)  

Create 2 EC2 or VirtualBox instances and then follow the above link to install Nagios on one of them and then monitor the other server. 
You can use a Docker version of Nagios if you want, but then you will be on your own and would not need to follow the above link!
